# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a set of machine learning algorithms that attempts to model high-level abstractions in data using Computational architectures that support multiple and iterative nonlinear transformations of data expressed in matrix or tensor form

> **Tip**: Machines get 99% correct the images they are interpreting

**Shazam** allows you to identify which song you are listening to, with small fragments of it, analyzing the frequencies, with binomial code, in just 5 seconds it transforms and identifies the pattern and makes recommendations based on the search, replicating and improving the information

**Tesla** also works with deep learning, using binomial code to make 1 go forward and 0 stop, identifying the objects it encounters along the way

**SocialEyes**: Detection of eye problems in remote communities

**Bing**: Real-time Object Detection

**Siri**: Voice recognition and virtual assistant
