# Qualitative analysis in a business case



**Qualitative data**: The analysis of qualitative data is a process by which conclusions are drawn from unstructured and heterogeneous data that are not expressed numerically or quantifiably. We are talking about a process that allows, through a set of techniques, to draw conclusions from a mass of data in textual or narrative form, and even images

**Clusterize**: Group the problems, motivations and contacts on the part of the clients that we face. In this example, more than 500 types of contacts were classified into 4 categories:

* **Economic motivation**: They want their money back. This is the most serious since in addition to being a complaint, the money is returned to them
* **Questions**: Customers have doubts
* **Technological problems**: Relevant to identify technical failures of the service or product
* **Company policy**: Privacity, data protection, and so on

**Classification**: Define the reasons behind the messages, when we have classified them within a category we will delve into the reasons for contact in a geolocated way so that we will have specificity in each social context

> **Tip**: Quantitative data tells us which customers complained and how many times\
> The qualitative data explains the reason for your complaint (money back, technological problems, company policies, and so on)
